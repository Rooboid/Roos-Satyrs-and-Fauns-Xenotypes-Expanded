				<!-- Project "Pan" -->
			
				<li>desc-> Project "Pan"\n\nThe first page of this book unfurls into a large poster of “Pan”, the supposed first satyr to be ever created.\n\nFollowing an expedition to the ancient ruins of Helike, the Project Pan research team conceptualised the satyr as a poor-man’s alternative to the Highmate. But for less liveable and impoverished habitats, like Rimworlds and Industrial Worlds.\n\nProject Pan received substantial funding from the government, and the first batch of satyrs were grown. “Pan” was the first to emerge from their vat, and is often revered as a God in satyr communities.</li>
				
				<!-- Origin -->
			
				<li>desc-> Origin\n\nThis book explains that the original satyrs were intended as low-budget alternatives to highmates. Planets such as Novaroma and Sophiamunda are perfect homes for highmates due to their widely habitable conditions, but what about those yearning for love on, say, a Rimworld?\n\nAnd so, the satyr was born; designed to be a sultry companion that thrived on all kinds of terrain. But unfortunately, due to budget constraints on the project, the satyr fell short of its design, emerging from its pod as an uncouth, sleazy goat-man who’s lovin’ prowess fell extremely below the mark.\n\nFor these reasons, the initial batch of satyrs were considered a failure, and were dumped on a nearby rimworld to avoid the press deeming them a waste of public spending.</li>
				
				<!-- Fae Stories -->
			
				<li>desc-> Fae Stories\n\nThere are countless legends in Fae cultures surrounding the origin of the satyrs. Some believe that they were given life by a hedonistic God to proselytize his teachings to lost-in-their-way mortals.\n\nOthers believe that the fauns and the satyrs were conceived as foils to one another, to keep the world’s balance in check.\n\nThe following pages list other speculations regarding the satyrs’ origins, providing citations to other issues of the Xenotype Index for further reading.</li>
				
				<!-- Myths -->
			
				<li>desc-> Myths\n\nThere is a common belief that offerings of alcohol must be left outside one’s home during the colder months. This comes from the idea that satyrs who would have once spent their evenings basking in the warm, Jugust sun would now be cold, and would intrude on people’s homes to keep themselves warm. Perhaps with the expectation of getting some lovin’ too.\n\nAlcohol left outside was intended to intoxicate the satyrs before they entered the premises, making them either too exhausted to enact their schemes, or too weak to resist a clobbering. \n\nThis copy of the book has a handwritten annotation that reads “LIES AND SLANDER” beside the final paragraph.</li>
				
				<!-- Notable Satyrs -->
			
				<li>desc-> Notable Satyrs\n\nThis book contains page-after-page of notable satyrs in history, from musicians to blacksmiths to marital aid manufacturers. Whatever a “marital aid” is.\n\nMany satyrs in history have clearly defied their lecherous reputations and have made successes of themselves in a wide plethora of fields. The final chapter of the book even shows images of some of the things that these satyrs invented. \n\n...So that’s what a “marital aid” is.</li>
				
				<!-- Art -->
			
				<li>desc-> Art\n\nThis volume of the Xenotype Index contains a bountiful array of satyr-produced artworks, some of which you seem to even seem to recognise.\n\nWhile yes, 90% of these art pieces depict their subject matters with absolutely no clothes on, there is a certain artistry to how they’re depicted that’s idiosyncratic of the satyrs’ creative style.</li>
				
				<!-- Talents -->
			
				<li>desc-> Talents\n\nThe opening paragraph of this book explains that a satyrs’ heartbeat pounds in a swing beat. Their innate musicality from birth goes unparalleled and continues to baffle scientists across the entire star system.\n\nIt isn’t clear why they have such a genetic link with music, but research shows that the same music performed by a satyr evokes a more intense reaction from listeners than when performed by human.\n\nRegarding their other talents, satyrs are to able survive in incredibly arid conditions and can sprint with the grace and speed of a gazelle. If rightfully motivated to, that is.</li>
				
				<!-- Melodic Abilities -->
			
				<li>desc-> Melodic Abilities\n\nThe opening chapter of the book looks into a number of cases in which a satyr has reportedly altered the very matter around them simply through song. From healing the ill to even resurrecting the dead, these miracles go scientifically unexplained to this day.\n\nResearchers ponder if the very concepts of these songs, say, the very notes themselves, are imbued with unknowable, omnipresent archotechnology? Could it be that every occurrence of these songs “patches” the fabric of space and time around them to inject these psychic phenomena into those who...\n\n...You put the book down. You didn’t expect a book about satyrs to hurt your head this much.</li>
				
				<!-- History -->
			
				<li>desc-> History\n\nThe satyrs were deemed a total failure by those who engineered them, and as such, were dumped on a nearby rimworld to avoid any negative press attention.\n\nThese original satyrs were offered salvation by a faction of timid fauns – a genetically-engineered cervine xenotype. The two races seemed to complement one another’s weaknesses, and their union is stated to be the only reason that either xenotype still exists today.</li>
				
				<!-- The Satyrs and the Fauns -->
			
				<li>desc-> The Satyrs and the Fauns\n\nSatyrs and fauns are often depicted as two sides of the same coin. The accompanying illustration in the book even affirms this, portraying a faun as the “sun”, and a satyr as the “moon”.\n\nThe two xenotypes’ symbiosis goes all the way back to their conception, and records show that they have naturally chosen to cohabitate ever since. While war raged on across the rim for various reasons, tribes made up of both of these xenotypes remained shtum.\n\nInstead of engaging in such conflict, they worked towards maintaining their own frivolous slice of the rim in peace.</li>
